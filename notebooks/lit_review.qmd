#### Preferential Sampling Considerations

Summary of the article, [Geostatistical Inference Under Preferential Sampling](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2009.00701.x):

1. Concept of Preferential Sampling: The article discusses the concept of preferential sampling, where the locations of data points are often selected with a preference for values of the process that are either unusually large or small. In your project, this could translate to the tendency to have more data from areas where bird species are more commonly found or are easier to observe. Understanding and accounting for this bias could improve the accuracy of your models.
2. Model-Based Approach: The authors propose a model-based approach to geostatistical inference when the data are preferentially sampled. This methodology could potentially be applied in your project to account for any bias in the geographical distribution of your bird observation data.
3. Likelihood-Based Approach to Inference: The authors present a likelihood-based approach to inference for the proposed model. This statistical approach could be useful in your project when you are comparing different machine learning algorithms for modeling bird species distribution.
4. Bias Correction: The authors found that ignoring preferential sampling can lead to biased estimates of risk. In your project, this could translate to biased predictions of bird species presence. The methodology proposed in the article could potentially be used to correct this bias.
5. Extension to Spatio-Temporal Processes: The authors suggest that their approach can be extended to spatio-temporal processes. This could be particularly relevant to your project, as bird species presence is likely to vary both spatially and temporally.

Ideas for implementation:

* Pre-Processing - Observation Data Pre-Processing: During the pre-processing of your bird observation data, you could consider whether there is any bias in the locations of your data points. For example, are there more data points in areas where bird species are more commonly found or easier to observe? If so, you might need to account for this bias in your models. This could involve adjusting the weights of your points or using a model-based approach to account for preferential sampling.
* Sampling and Splitting - Pseudo-Absence Selection: When selecting pseudo-absence points, you could consider whether the locations of these are independent of the bird species presence process. If not, you might need to adjust your selection process to account for this dependence. This could involve using a likelihood-based approach to inference, as suggested in the article.
* Modeling: When comparing different machine learning algorithms for modeling bird species distribution, you could consider whether any of these algorithms are more or less susceptible to bias due to preferential sampling. If so, you might need to adjust your model selection process accordingly. This could involve using a model-based approach to account for preferential sampling, as suggested in the article.
* Prediction: When making predictions on the presence of each bird species across the entire US, you could consider whether your predictions are biased due to preferential sampling. If so, you might need to adjust your prediction process to correct this bias. This could involve using a model-based approach to account for preferential sampling, as suggested in the article.



#### Pseudo-Absence Generation Considerations

Sumary of the article, [On pseudo-absence generation and machine learning for locust breeding ground prediction in Africa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03904):

The article titled "On pseudo-absence generation and machine learning for locust breeding ground prediction in Africa" by authors Ibrahim Salihu Yusuf, Kale-ab Tessera, Thomas Tumiel, Zohra Slim, Amine Kerkeni, Sella Nevo, and Arnu Pretorius, was published in the AI for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (AI+HADR) workshop, NeurIPS 2021.

The paper discusses the threat of desert locust outbreaks to the food security of a large part of Africa and the impact on the livelihoods of millions of people. The authors propose machine learning (ML) as an effective approach to locust distribution modeling, which could assist in early warning.

However, ML requires a significant amount of labeled data to train. Most publicly available labeled data on locusts are presence-only data, where only the sightings of locusts being present at a location are recorded. Therefore, prior work using ML has resorted to pseudo-absence generation methods as a way to circumvent this issue.

The most commonly used approach is to randomly sample points in a region of interest while ensuring that these sampled pseudo-absence points are at least a specific distance away from true presence points. In this paper, the authors compare this random sampling approach to more advanced pseudo-absence generation methods, such as environmental profiling and optimal background extent limitation, specifically for predicting desert locust breeding grounds in Africa.

Interestingly, they find that for the algorithms they tested, namely logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forests, and maximum entropy, all popular in prior work, the logistic model performed significantly better than the more sophisticated ensemble methods, both in terms of prediction accuracy and F1 score.

Although background extent limitation combined with random sampling boosted performance for ensemble methods, for logistic regression this was not the case, and instead, a significant improvement was obtained when using environmental profiling.

In light of this, the authors conclude that a simpler ML approach such as logistic regression combined with more advanced pseudo-absence generation, specifically environmental profiling, can be a sensible and effective approach to predicting locust breeding grounds across Africa.

Ideas for implementation:

1. Pseudo-Absence Selection
    * In your project, you are generating pseudo-absence points by selecting points where other bird species have been observed but not the target species. However, the paper suggests that more advanced pseudo-absence generation methods, such as environmental profiling, can improve model performance. You could consider implementing environmental profiling in your pseudo-absence selection process. This would involve selecting pseudo-absence points based on the environmental characteristics of the areas where the target species has not been observed. For example, if a certain bird species is known to prefer forested areas, pseudo-absence points could be selected from non-forested areas.
    * Implementation: Research and implement environmental profiling for pseudo-absence selection. This might involve adjusting your current pseudo-absence selection mechanism to select points based on environmental characteristics rather than just the absence of the target species.
2. Model Selection
    * Your project involves a comparative analysis of several machine learning algorithms. The paper found that a simpler machine learning approach, such as logistic regression, performed significantly better than more sophisticated ensemble methods when combined with advanced pseudo-absence generation. Therefore, you might want to give more consideration to simpler models like logistic regression in your analysis.
    * Implementation: Include logistic regression in your comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms. Evaluate its performance in combination with your new pseudo-absence selection method.
3. Model Evaluation
    * The paper used prediction accuracy and F1 score to evaluate model performance. In addition to the performance metrics you are currently using (partial ROC, F1, precision, recall, and accuracy), you might consider using other metrics that are more suitable for imbalanced datasets, such as the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC).
    * Implementation: Incorporate additional performance metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets, such as AUPRC, into your model evaluation process.
4. Data Pre-processing
    * The paper emphasizes the importance of proper data pre-processing, especially when dealing with presence-only data. You might want to review your data pre-processing steps to ensure that they are suitable for your presence-only bird species data.
    * Implementation: Review your data pre-processing steps to ensure they are suitable for presence-only data. Make any necessary adjustments based on best practices for dealing with presence-only data.
    
    
#### Bayesian Methods

Sumary of the article, [Bayesian Modeling and MCMC Computation in Linear Logistic Regression for Presence-only Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1232):

The article titled "Bayesian Modeling and MCMC Computation in Linear Logistic Regression for Presence-only Data" by authors Jinfeng Xu, Jun Zhu, and Xiaoyue Niu, focuses on the development and application of Bayesian modeling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation in the context of linear logistic regression for presence-only data.

The authors start by acknowledging the challenges in analyzing presence-only data, which is a type of data where only the presence of a species or event is recorded, but not its absence. This type of data is common in ecological studies, among others.

To address these challenges, the authors propose a Bayesian modeling approach. Bayesian modeling is a statistical method that incorporates prior knowledge about a parameter into the analysis. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex models and limited data.

In addition to Bayesian modeling, the authors also utilize Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation. MCMC is a method for estimating the distribution of a variable of interest by constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution. This method is often used in Bayesian analysis to estimate posterior distributions.

The authors apply these methods to linear logistic regression, a statistical method used to model the relationship between a binary response variable and one or more explanatory variables. They provide a detailed explanation of their methodology, including the specification of the prior distribution, the construction of the likelihood function, and the implementation of the MCMC algorithm.

The authors also present a case study to demonstrate the application of their methodology. They use presence-only data from the Giant Panda distribution in the Minshan Mountains to estimate the effects of various environmental factors on the presence of the species. The results show that their method provides a robust and reliable estimation of the parameters of interest.

The authors conclude by discussing the advantages and potential limitations of their approach. They suggest that their method can be extended to other types of presence-only data and encourage further research in this area.

Ideas for implementation:

1. Model Selection: You mentioned that you plan to compare several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, LightGBM, XGBoost, KNN, Random Forest, Maximum Entropy, MCMC, and SPDE/INLA. The Bayesian modeling and MCMC computation approach can be used to enhance your logistic regression model. This approach can provide a more nuanced understanding of the underlying data and can be particularly useful when dealing with complex models and limited data.
2. Handling Presence-Only Data: Your project involves dealing with presence-only data, which is a common challenge in ecological studies. The Bayesian modeling and MCMC computation approach can be used to handle this type of data more effectively. Specifically, the approach can be used to estimate the parameters of interest in your logistic regression model, providing a more robust and reliable estimation.
3. Pseudo-Absence Selection: The Bayesian modeling and MCMC computation approach can be used to improve your pseudo-absence selection mechanism. Specifically, the approach can be used to estimate the distribution of pseudo-absence points, which can help to address the inherent challenge of absence data in presence-only datasets.
4. Model Evaluation: The Bayesian modeling and MCMC computation approach can also be used to evaluate the performance of your models. Specifically, the approach can be used to estimate the posterior distributions of your performance metrics, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of your models.
5. Predictive Modeling: Lastly, the Bayesian modeling and MCMC computation approach can be used to enhance your predictive modeling. Specifically, the approach can be used to estimate the probabilities of bird species presence across the entire US, providing a more accurate and reliable prediction.

In summary, the Bayesian modeling and MCMC computation approach can be used to enhance various aspects of your project, from model selection and handling presence-only data to pseudo-absence selection, model evaluation, and predictive modeling. By incorporating this approach into your project, you can potentially improve the accuracy and reliability of your results, providing a more nuanced understanding of avian habitat tendencies.

#### Finite-sample Equivalence in Statistical Models

Summary of the article, [Finite-sample equivalence in statistical models for presence-only data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6950):

The article "Finite-sample equivalence in statistical models for presence-only data" by William Fithian and Trevor Hastie discusses statistical modeling of presence-only data, which has gained significant attention in ecological literature. The authors focus on three methods: the inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP) model, maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling of species distributions, and logistic regression models. They explain why the IPP intensity function is a more natural object of inference in presence-only studies than occurrence probability.

The authors show that IPP and Maxent give the exact same estimate for density, but logistic regression generally yields a different estimate in finite samples. When the model is misspecified, logistic regression and the IPP may have substantially different asymptotic limits with large data sets. The authors propose "infinitely weighted logistic regression," which is exactly equivalent to the IPP in finite samples. Consequently, many already-implemented methods extending logistic regression can also extend the Maxent and IPP models in directly analogous ways using this technique.

The paper also discusses the challenges of sampling bias in presence-only studies and proposes a model for the sightings process as an occurrence process thinned by incomplete observation.

Ideas for implementation:

1. Model Selection and Interpretation: The article suggests that the inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP) model and maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling yield the same estimates for density in finite samples. This could influence your choice of models to compare in your project. If computational resources are limited, you might choose to focus on one of these two models, rather than both, given their equivalence in finite samples.
2. Logistic Regression Adjustments: The authors propose an "infinitely weighted logistic regression," which is exactly equivalent to the IPP in finite samples. If you're using logistic regression in your project, you might consider adjusting it to this infinitely weighted version for better equivalence with the IPP and Maxent models.
3. Handling Sampling Bias: The paper discusses the challenges of sampling bias in presence-only studies and proposes a model for the sightings process as an occurrence process thinned by incomplete observation. You might consider incorporating this approach into your data pre-processing steps, particularly when selecting pseudo-absence points. For example, you could adjust the selection mechanism to account for potential sampling bias in the Project FeederWatch Observation Data.
4. Extending Logistic Regression: The authors suggest that many already-implemented methods extending logistic regression can also extend the Maxent and IPP models in directly analogous ways. This could be particularly useful if you're considering extending your models to account for additional complexities in the data. For example, you might consider using regularized logistic regression or other extensions to better handle high-dimensional feature spaces.
5. Asymptotic Behavior: The paper discusses the different asymptotic limits of logistic regression and the IPP when the model is misspecified. If you're working with large data sets, you might want to consider the potential implications of these different asymptotic behaviors on your model's performance and robustness.
6. Model Evaluation: The authors' findings about the equivalence of certain models in finite samples could also influence your model evaluation strategy. For example, you might choose to focus on comparing the performance of models that are not equivalent in finite samples, such as logistic regression and the IPP.

#### Bias Correction using Species Pooling

Summary of the article, [Bias Correction in Species Distribution Models: Pooling Survey and Collection Data for Multiple Species](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7274):

The article "Bias Correction in Species Distribution Models: Pooling Survey and Collection Data for Multiple Species" by Guisan et al. discusses a novel approach to correct bias in species distribution models (SDMs). The authors recognize that SDMs are often biased due to the nature of the data collected, which is typically skewed towards easily detectable species and areas that are easy to access.

To address this issue, the authors propose a new method that combines survey and collection data from multiple species. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of species distribution, as it incorporates data from a wider range of sources and species.

The authors tested their method using data from the Swiss Breeding Bird Survey and the Swiss Ornithological Institute. The results showed that their approach significantly reduced bias in the SDMs, leading to more accurate predictions of species distribution.

The authors conclude that their method can be a valuable tool for ecologists and conservationists, as it can improve the accuracy of SDMs and thus inform more effective conservation strategies. They also suggest that their approach could be applied to other types of ecological data, opening up new possibilities for bias correction in ecological research.

Ideas for implementation:

1. Data Collection and Pooling: The article emphasizes the importance of pooling data from multiple sources to reduce bias. In your project, you are already using data from multiple sources, which is a good practice. However, you might consider expanding the range of data sources if possible. For instance, you could look for additional bird observation databases or environmental datasets that could provide more comprehensive coverage of the species and environmental factors you are interested in.
2. Bias Correction: The article presents a method for correcting bias in species distribution models by combining survey and collection data. In your project, you could implement a similar approach to correct for potential biases in your data. For example, you could adjust your models to account for the fact that bird observations are likely to be more frequent in areas that are easily accessible to humans, which could skew the apparent distribution of species.
3. Modeling and Prediction: The article's approach to reducing bias could also improve the accuracy of your predictive models. By ensuring that your models are based on a balanced and comprehensive dataset, you can increase the reliability of your predictions about bird species distribution across the United States. This could be particularly useful when comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms, as it would allow you to evaluate them on a fair and unbiased basis.
4. Conservation Implications: The article highlights the potential conservation implications of accurate species distribution models. In your project, you could use your improved models to identify areas where bird species are likely to be found but are currently under-surveyed. These areas could be targeted for future conservation efforts, helping to protect species that might otherwise be overlooked.
5. Pseudo-Absence Selection: The article's method of pooling data from multiple species could be adapted to improve your pseudo-absence selection mechanism. By considering the presence of other species when selecting pseudo-absence points, you could ensure that these points represent areas that are genuinely unsuitable for the species of interest, rather than just areas where it has not been observed.
6. Model Evaluation: The bias correction method proposed in the article could also be used to refine your model evaluation process. By assessing how well your models correct for bias, you could gain additional insights into their performance and reliability. This could be incorporated into your existing performance metrics, such as partial ROC, F1, precision, recall, and accuracy.
